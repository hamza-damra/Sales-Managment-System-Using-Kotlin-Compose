## Conclusion

The current backend provides a solid foundation with core CRUD operations for customers, products, and sales. However, to fully support the rich frontend experience, significant additional development is required, particularly in the areas of supplier management, returns processing, promotions, and advanced inventory features.

The estimated development effort for complete backend coverage is approximately 8-12 weeks for a team of 2-3 backend developers, depending on the complexity of business logic and integration requirements.
